    "### Exercise: Data Labeling with Label Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "Learn how to use Label Studio to label a dataset for a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites:\n",
    "- Basic understanding of data labeling and its importance in machine learning.\n",
    "- Label Studio installed on your machine. You can install it using the following command:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install label-studio\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install and Start Label Studio:**\n",
    "   - Open your terminal and run the following command to start Label Studio:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     label-studio start\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the Label Studio interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a New Project:**\n",
    "   - Click on \"Create\" to start a new project.\n",
    "   - Name your project \"Image Classification\" and provide a brief description.\n",
    "   - Click \"Next\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Up Labeling Interface:**\n",
    "   - Choose \"Image\" as the data type you want to label.\n",
    "   - Select \"Image Classification\" as the labeling interface.\n",
    "   - Click \"Next\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Upload Data:**\n",
    "   - Prepare a dataset of images. You can use a sample dataset of images from any public source (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet).\n",
    "   - Click on \"Upload\" and select the images you want to label.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Define Labels:**\n",
    "   - Define the labels you want to use for classification. For example, if you are classifying animals, you might have labels like \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Bird\", etc.\n",
    "   - Click \"Next\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Start Labeling:**\n",
    "   - Begin labeling the images by selecting the appropriate label for each image.\n",
    "   - Label at least 20 images to get a good amount of labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Export Labeled Data:**\n",
    "   - Once you have labeled the images, click on \"Export\" to download the labeled data.\n",
    "   - Choose the export format (e.g., JSON) and save the file to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Analyze the Labeled Data:**\n",
    "   - Open the exported file and examine the labeled data.\n",
    "   - Discuss how this labeled data can be used to train a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discussion Questions:\n",
    "1. Why is data labeling important in machine learning?\n",
    "2. What challenges did you face while labeling the data?\n",
    "3. How can the quality of labeled data affect the performance of a machine learning model?\n",
    "4. What strategies can be used to ensure high-quality data labeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission:\n",
    "- Submit the exported labeled data file.\n",
    "- Write a brief report (1-2 pages) answering the discussion questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will help students understand the practical aspects of data labeling and its significance in machine learning projects."
